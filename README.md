- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Guillaume Racicot
- I'm interested in developer experience, build system and libraries.
- When developers make a mess, it's because they lack the tools they needed
- I make the tools, usually in the form of library, dev environments and frameworks.
- I mostly do C++, lil bit of rust on the side
